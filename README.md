Developed using Unreal Engine and C++, Obstacle Overrun is a dynamic game environment where players navigate through a series of challenging obstacles designed to test their reflexes and strategic thinking. This project combines high-performance gameplay with adaptive AI to create an ever-evolving challenge that keeps players engaged and on their toes. 🕹️🔥

Central to the project is a robust collision detection system built from scratch in C++, leveraging Unreal Engine’s powerful physics engine to ensure accurate and responsive interactions. Every obstacle and environmental element is meticulously crafted to provide realistic physics simulations, making gameplay smooth and immersive. 🔧💻

To enhance the gaming experience, custom C++ algorithms drive adaptive AI behaviors that modify obstacle patterns and enemy actions in real-time based on player performance. This ensures that the game remains challenging, yet fair, with the difficulty scaling dynamically to match the player’s skill level. 🤖🎯

Responsive controls are another highlight of Obstacle Overrun. By implementing efficient input handling and real-time feedback loops, the game delivers precise and intuitive control over player movements, which is essential for navigating complex environments. Extensive testing and iterative optimization further refined the experience, balancing challenge with playability. 🏆⚙️

The project not only demonstrates technical prowess in C++ and Unreal Engine but also reflects a creative approach to game design, merging adaptive AI and physics-based mechanics to create an engaging, ever-changing gameplay experience. Obstacle Overrun stands as a testament to innovative design and engineering excellence in the realm of interactive entertainment. 🚀✨
